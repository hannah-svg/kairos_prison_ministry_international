						<h1>Audience & Goals</h1>
						<p>In determining the audience of the redesigned website, I brainstormed all the potential people groups affected by or involved with Kairos.

I first organized the general audience into two groups: those who receive help and those who give help.</p>

						<section>
							<h2>Audience</h2>
							<h3>Receive Help</h3>
								<p>These groups are directly and indirectly helped by Kairos Prison Ministry. Whether the offender has parents who are still alive, a spouse or a significant other, or is the parent of a child themself, their prison sentence significantly changes the family. By proxy, the extended family is often negatively affected as adult siblings with their own families as well as grandparents can deal with estrangement or disappointment.</p>
								<p>As for those in prison, Kairos reaches out to the individuals serving a temporary sentence and those who are on death row at the Lousiana State Penitentiary, famously known by the name "Angola." For those whose prison sentence is anywhere from multiple decades long to a lifetime sentence, Kairos conducts Weekends of talks, discussions, prayer, and chapel meditations. As a result of these Weekends, the prison officials at Angola have reported continued improvement in the prison living environment.</p>
							<h3>Give Help</h3>
								<p>Those who give help are distinctly noted on the current website. Volunteers and Donators are addressed immediately as the viewer arrives at the home page, while the families of inmates are directly connected with through Kairos Outside.</p>

								</section>

							<section>
							<h3>Pro-Prison Ministry & Anti-Prison Ministry</h3>
							<p>Prison ministry has overwhelmingly positive effects for those inside prison, outside prison, and those in the community. Those youth who repeatedly offend on a smaller scale and go to jail are impacted by Kairos Torch, the youth mentorship program, where they learn self-esteem, anger management, and short- and long-term goal setting. Pastors and prison chaplains are able to see the lives of inmates transformed and their hearts changed with the freedom of the Gospel. Once inmates are released, the community and future employers benefit from committed employees who often have an others-focused, God-centered perspective and new desire to become productive citizens. Finally, prison officials from the commissioner to the guards are witnesses to the life change and freedom that all took place behind bars.</p>
							<p>In my research, I found very few people groups who were against prison outreach. That said, prison wardens and city or community officials may have reason to distrust the ministry because they regularly see the same inmates go back into the prison system. Additionally, unbelievers may be hesitant to be on board with the life transforming affects that prison ministry can have, simply because they have not personally witnessed the saving faith of a personal relationship with Jesus. The prison abolitionst population is also anti-prison ministry because they believe society should just do away with prisons in general.</p>
