							<h3>Receiving & Giving Help</h3>

								<p>First, I brainstormed all the potential people groups affected by or involved with Kairos. I then organized the general audience into two groups: those who receive help and those who give help. These groups are both directly and indirectly helped by Kairos Prison Ministry. Whether the offender has parents who are still alive, a spouse or a significant other, or is the parent of a child themself, their prison sentence significantly changes the family. By proxy, the extended family is often negatively affected as adult siblings with their own families as well as grandparents may deal with estrangement or disappointment.</p>
								<p>As for those in prison, Kairos reaches out to the individuals serving a temporary sentence and those who are on death row. For example, places like the Lousiana State Penitentiary, famously known by the name "Angola," are dramatically impacted by prison ministry as those on death row find value and freedom even in their seemingly hopeless situation. For those whose prison sentence is anywhere from multiple decades long to a lifetime sentence, Kairos conducts "Weekends" of talks, discussions, prayer, and chapel meditations. As a result of these three-day "Weekends," the prison officials at Angola have reported continued improvement in the prison living environment.</p>
								<p>Those who give help are distinctly noted on the current website. Volunteers and Donators are addressed immediately as the viewer arrives at the home page, while the families of inmates are directly connected with via Kairos Outside.</p>

							<h3>Pro-Prison Ministry & Anti-Prison Ministry</h3>
							<p>Prison ministry has overwhelmingly positive effects for those inside prison, outside prison, and those in the nearby community. Those youth who repeatedly offend on a smaller scale and go to jail are impacted by Kairos Torch, the youth mentorship program, where they learn self-esteem, anger management, and short- and long-term goal setting. Pastors and prison chaplains are able to see the lives of inmates transformed and their hearts changed with the freedom of the Gospel. Once inmates are released, the community and future employers benefit from committed employees who often have an others-focused, God-centered perspective and new desire to become productive citizens. Finally, prison officials from the commissioner to the guards are witnesses to the life change and freedom that takes place behind bars.</p>
							<p>In my research I found very few people groups who were against prison outreach. That said, prison wardens and city or community officials may have reason to distrust the ministry because they regularly see the same inmates go back into the prison system. Additionally, unbelievers may be hesitant to be on board with the life transforming effects that prison ministry can have, simply because they have not personally witnessed the saving faith of a personal relationship with Jesus. The prison abolitionst population is also anti-prison ministry because they believe society should just do away with prisons in general.</p>

							<h2>Specific Goals</h2>
							<p>Next, I narrowed down my goals into user groups and then listed the users' goals in order of importance. I also listed what action steps the website needed in order to fulfill these specific goals.</p>
