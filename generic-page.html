						<h1>Preliminary Research</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>"Kairos"</strong> - a Greek word meaning "in the fullness of time"
							<dd <align=class>Kairos Prison Ministry International is a Christian lay-led non-profit devoted to ministering to prisoners, incarcerated youth, and their families.</p>
					</header>
						<h2>About</h2>
					<p>As one of the largest international prison ministries in the world, Kairos was founded in 1976 and seeks to change hearts, transform lives, and impact the world. Kairos draws their mission statement and base their service on the foundation of Matthew 25:36 where Jesus says, "I was in prison and you visited me." Additionally, the home page is designed to draw attention to three specific action points: Prayer, Donatation, and Volunteerism.</p>

						</div>

						<p> In line with their threefold mission, Kairos Prison Ministry is organized into three programs: Kairos Inside, Kairos Outside, and Kairos Torch. Kairos Inside focuses on transforming lives in prison through decreasing violence and reducing recidivism. Kairos Outside seeks to be a comfortable, non-judgmental retreat for women as they are separated from loved ones in prison. Kairos Torch offers a mentorship program to incarcerated youth aged 25 and younger where reasoning skills and constructive life choices are encouraged by a designated mentor.</p>

						<h2>Stats</h2>
							<ul class="info">
							<li>37 U.S. states</li>

						<h2>Brand</h2>
							<p>Almost every place of text body on every page is in Calibri normal. Aside from the yellow and red buttons, the website uses the brand's colors of dark blue and white. In the pages that describe the three programs, red text designates a clickable site to learn more. Call-out boxes in red are also set in the side margins to display an impactful quote. Additionally, there is little continuity between images across pages as some contain stock images and others show actual inmates or volunteers.</p>

						<h2>Social Media</h2>
							<p>Kairos is most present on Facebook and Twitter. On Facebook they emphasize the importance of prayer, especially during this time of COVID-19. They echo the same calls to prayer on their Twitter page while also sharing encouraging words from their CEO Evelyn Lemly, the occasional uplifting quote, and the link to their prayer request forum.</p>
							<p>The Instagram page is much less trafficked with only 9 posts and 0 followers. Their YouTube page, by contrast, hold just under 30 videos, most of which are testimonies, and has 737 subscribers. On a few pages, the social media icons include a LinkedIn icon, but no Kairos Prison Ministry page exists.</p>

						<h2>Branch-Off Sites</h2>
							<p><strong>United States</strong> - State Chapters</p>
							<p>It stood out to me how contrasted the websites were between the US and the UK. State chapter pages are very simple with a similar page heirarchy and layout, but different brand colors and overall theme. By contrast, the UK's page is more sophisticated, tasteful, and has a clear heirarchy of information.</p>
