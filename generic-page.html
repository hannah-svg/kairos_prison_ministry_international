						<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
						<h3>About</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\heroimage.jpg" alt=""/></span>As one of the largest international prison ministries in the world, Kairos was founded in 1976 as a "Fourth Day" ministry that seeks to change hearts, transform lives, and impact the world. Kairos Prison Ministry International draws their mission statement and bases their service on the foundation of Matthew 25:36 where Jesus says, "I was in prison and you visited me." As a Christian, non-denominational, lay-led ministry, Kairos' reach spans the United States and abroad. Their home page is designed to draw attention to three specific action steps: Prayer, Donatation, and Volunteerism.</p>
				 		<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\threeprograms.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
						<p><span>In line with their threefold mission, Kairos Prison Ministry is organized into three programs: Kairos Inside, Kairos Outside, and Kairos Torch. Kairos Inside focuses on transforming lives in prison through decreasing violence and reducing recidivism. Kairos Outside seeks to be a comfortable, non-judgmental retreat for women as they are separated from loved ones in prison. Kairos Torch offers a mentorship program to incarcerated youth ages 25 and younger where reasoning skills and constructive life choices are encouraged by a designated mentor.</span></p>

						<h3>Stats</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\whereweserve.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
							<ul class="info">
							<li>in 37 U.S. states</li>
							<li>in 9 countries</li>
							<li>30,000+ volunteers</li>
							<li>27,000 people reached annually</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Discrepancy - The above information was taken from the official Kairos website; however, the graphic above, taken from a separate Kairos state chapter website has different statistics from 2014.</p>

						<h3>Brand</h3>
							<p>Almost every text body on every subpage is in Calibri Normal. Aside from the yellow and red buttons, the website uses the brand's colors of dark blue and white. In the pages that describe the three programs, red text designates a clickable site to learn more. Call-out boxes in red are also set in the side margins to display an impactful quote. Additionally, there is little continuity between images across pages as some contain stock images and others show actual inmates or volunteers.</p>
							<div class="image fit">
								<img src="images\c_brand.jpg" alt="collage of screenshots"/>
							</div>

						<h3>Social Media</h3>
							<p>Kairos is most present on Facebook and Twitter. On Facebook they emphasize the importance of prayer, especially during COVID-19. They echo the same calls to prayer on their Twitter page, while also sharing encouraging words from their CEO Evelyn Lemly, an occasional uplifting quote, and the link to their prayer request forum. The Instagram page is much less trafficked with only 9 posts and zero followers. Their YouTube page, by contrast, holds just under 30 videos, most of which are testimonials, and has 737 subscribers. On a few pages, the social media icons include a LinkedIn icon, but no Kairos Prison Ministry LinkedIn page exists.</p>

						<h3>Branch-Off Sites</h3>
							<div class="image fit">
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\c_outsidesites.jpg" alt="two Kairos state website" /></span></p>
							<p>United States</p>
							<p>Each state's site contrasts significantly with the United Kingdom site. State chapter pages are very simple and have a similar page heirarchy and layout; however, they each include different brand colors and overall theme. By contrast, the UK's page is more sophisticated, tasteful, and has a clear heirarchy of information. It's text-heavy but not boring.</p>
							<p>United Kingdom Website</p>
							<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images\c_unitedkingdom.jpg" alt="united kingdom website screenshots" /></span></p>
						</div>

						<h3>Other Relevant Pages</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\donationpage.jpg" alt="donation page" /></span></p>
							<p><strong>Donate -</strong></p>
							<p>This subpage has an entirely different theme than the other pages on Kairos' website. Italics and serif typefaces used to give a softer, more inviting and approachable feeling. Buttons with set donation amounts are large and the text is white on blue. The donation amounts are set high on the page to show importance and allow donating to happen in a few easy steps.</p>
							<p><strong>Blog -</strong></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\kairosblog.jpg" alt="donation page" /></span></p>
							<p>Here visitors and followers are updated monthly with what Kairos volunteers are doing to raise funds and grow their programs, giving, and volunteerism.</p>
							<p>The page functions as its own separate subpage on the website and includes the same tabs found on the homepage, but the title are in all-caps in a different typeface. Again, the LinkedIn icon is included in the other social medias, but no LinkedIn page exists behind the button. On the mobile version of the website, no social media icons are present.</p>
							<div class="image right">
								<p><span class-"image right"><img src="images\legacy.jpg" alt="kairos legacy webpage" /></span></p>
							</div>
							<p><strong>Kairos Legacy -</strong></p>
							<p>Created as a separate page from Kairos Prison Ministry, Kairos Legacy is a philanthropic planning website that encourages patrons to participate in Kairos' Free Estate Planning and give a financial gift towards the transforming work Kairos is doing across the globe.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					<p class="info">After understanding Kairos as an organization, I researched the other prison ministies and recent news in the area of prison ministry to get a feel for what design solutions have and have not worked in the past.</p>

			<h3>Foundations of Prison Ministry</h3>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\prisonfellowinstitute.jpg" /></span></p>
					<p>Information about prison ministry is typically found on the internet, in various print collateral in churches, and in Christian magazines. As a result, the bulk of my research was found on other prison ministry websites listed below.</p>
						<p>In fact, most prison ministries or coalitions have an online presence. Two grandfathers, so to speak, of prison outreach are Chuck Colson's Prison Fellowship, which focuses on Volunteerism and Donation, and Billy Graham's Institute for Prison Ministries, which focuses on equipping men and women to minister through correctional ministry. Both pages utilize blues and greens and have large images on the homepage.</p>

			<h3>Unsuccessful Design</h3>
				<p><strong>COPE - Coalition of Prison Evangelists</strong></p>
					<p>COPE is dedicated to equipping evangelists to provide fellowship and discipleship to those in prison. Their website is difficult to navigate for many reasons. The prevalence of the color red makes all the elements blend together. The webpages also get longer and more content-heavy with no visual breaks the farther you click.</p>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images\cope.jpg" alt=""/>
					</div>

			<h3>Successful Design</h3>
					<p>The most noticeable and effective elements in these three websites are the strong hierarchy, clear navigation, and use of yellow and gray.</p>
					<ul class="info">
						<li><strong>Crossroads Prison Ministries & Good News Jail & Prison Ministry</strong></li>
						<p>Both websites use a slideshow convention at the top of their homepage to keep the viewer's interest but also give a variety of information in clear sections. The generous negative space and centered text on the Crossroads website gives balance and cohesion. The Good News Jail & Prison website effectively uses infographics to condense information and organize their "Who We Are" section.</p>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images\crossroadspage.jpg" alt=""/>
							<p> </p>
							<img src="images\goodnewspage.jpg" alt=""/>
						</div>
						<li><strong>4th Purpose</strong></li>
						<p>This website is perhaps the most modern and easy to navigate out of the three. The hamburger navigational convention is discreetly placed in the top right corner when the page is narrowed, and the menu is frozen to the top of the page as the viewer scrolls. The logo is simple and probes the viewer to find out more about the organization. The homepage is clear and also uses infographics and short paragraphs to introduce its mission. 4th Purpose provides helpful and relevant statistics on the amount of individuals incarcerated across the world, as well as up-to-date information regarding how the organization is continuing to reach out and transform lives in the midst of COVID-19 through a digital series they created called Visitation 2.0.</p>
