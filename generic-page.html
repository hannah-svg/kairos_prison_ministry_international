						<h2>About</h2>
					<p>As one of the largest international prison ministries in the world, Kairos seeks to change hearts, transform lives, and impact the world. Kairos draws their mission statement and base their service on the foundation of Matthew 25:36 where Jesus says, "I was in prison and you visited me." Additionally, the home page is designed to draw attention to three specific action points: Prayer, Donatation, and Volunteerism.</p>

						</div>

						<p> In line with their threefold mission, Kairos Prison Ministry is organized into three programs: Kairos Inside, Kairos Outside, and Kairos Torch. Kairos Inside focuses on transforming lives in prison through decreasing violence and reducing recidivism. Kairos Outside seeks to be a comfortable, non-judgmental retreat for women as they are separated from loved ones in prison. Kairos Torch offers a mentorship program to incarcerated youth aged 25 and younger where reasoning skills and constructive life choices are encouraged by a designated mentor.</p>
