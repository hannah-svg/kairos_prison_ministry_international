						<h1>Preliminary Research</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>"Kairos"</strong> - a Greek word meaning "in the fullness of time"
							<dd <align=class>Kairos Prison Ministry International is a Christian lay-led non-profit devoted to ministering to prisoners, incarcerated youth, and their families.</p>
					</header>
						<h2>About</h2>
					<p>As one of the largest international prison ministries in the world, Kairos was founded in 1976 and seeks to change hearts, transform lives, and impact the world. Kairos draws their mission statement and base their service on the foundation of Matthew 25:36 where Jesus says, "I was in prison and you visited me." Additionally, the home page is designed to draw attention to three specific action points: Prayer, Donatation, and Volunteerism.</p>

						</div>

						<p> In line with their threefold mission, Kairos Prison Ministry is organized into three programs: Kairos Inside, Kairos Outside, and Kairos Torch. Kairos Inside focuses on transforming lives in prison through decreasing violence and reducing recidivism. Kairos Outside seeks to be a comfortable, non-judgmental retreat for women as they are separated from loved ones in prison. Kairos Torch offers a mentorship program to incarcerated youth aged 25 and younger where reasoning skills and constructive life choices are encouraged by a designated mentor.</p>

						<h2>Stats</h2>
							<ul class="info">
							<li>37 U.S. states</li>
							<li>9 countries</li>
							<li>30,000+ volunteers</li>
							<li>27,000 people reached annually</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Discrepancy</strong> - The above information was taken from the official Kairos website; however, the below graphic from a separate Kairos state chapter website has different statistics.</p>

						<h2>Brand</h2>
							<p>Almost every place of text body on every page is in Calibri normal. Aside from the yellow and red buttons, the website uses the brand's colors of dark blue and white. In the pages that describe the three programs, red text designates a clickable site to learn more. Call-out boxes in red are also set in the side margins to display an impactful quote. Additionally, there is little continuity between images across pages as some contain stock images and others show actual inmates or volunteers.</p>

							</div>

						<h2>Social Media</h2>
							<p>Kairos is most present on Facebook and Twitter. On Facebook they emphasize the importance of prayer, especially during this time of COVID-19. They echo the same calls to prayer on their Twitter page while also sharing encouraging words from their CEO Evelyn Lemly, the occasional uplifting quote, and the link to their prayer request forum.</p>
							<p>The Instagram page is much less trafficked with only 9 posts and 0 followers. Their YouTube page, by contrast, hold just under 30 videos, most of which are testimonies, and has 737 subscribers. On a few pages, the social media icons include a LinkedIn icon, but no Kairos Prison Ministry page exists.</p>

						<h2>Branch-Off Sites</h2>
							<p><strong>United States Websites</strong> - State Chapters</p>
							<p>It stood out to me how contrasted the websites were between the US and the UK. State chapter pages are very simple with a similar page heirarchy and layout, but different brand colors and overall theme. By contrast, the UK's page is more sophisticated, tasteful, and has a clear heirarchy of information.</p>

						<h2>Other Relevant Pages</h2>
							<p><strong>Donate</strong> - This has an entirely different theme than the other pages on Kairos' website. There are more italics and serif typefaces used to give a softer, more approachable feeling.</p>

							<p><strong>Blog</strong> - Here visitors and followers are updated monthly with what Kairos volunteers are doing to raise funds and grow their programs, giving, and volunteerism.</p>

							<p><strong>Kairos Legacy</strong> - A separate page from Kariso Prison Ministry, Kairos Legacy is a Gift Planning website that encourages patrons to participate in Kairos' Free Estate Planning and give a financial gift to support the transforming work Kairos is doing across the globe.</p>

					<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
					<p class="info">After understanding my design challenge, I researched the most recent news and updates in the area of prison ministry to get a feel for other ministries, what design solutions have and have not worked, and what was inspiring.</p>
				</header>

			<h2>Foundations of Prison Ministry</h2>
					<p>Information about prison ministry is typically found on the internet, in various print collateral in churches, and Christian magazines.</p>
						<p>That said, most prison ministries or coalitions do have an online presence. Two grandfathers, so to speak, of prison outreach are Chuck Colson's Prison Fellowship, which focuses on Volunteerism and Donation, and Billy Graham's Institute for Prison Ministries, which focuses on equipping men and women to minister through correctional ministry.</p>

								</div>

			<h2>Unsuccessful Design</h2>
				<p><strong>COPE - Coalition of Prison Evangelists</strong></p>
					<p>COPE is dedicated to equipping evangelists to provide fellowship and discipleship to those in prison. Their website is difficult to navigate for many reasons. The prevalence of the color red makes all the elements blend together. The webpages also get longer and more content-heavy with no visual breaks the farther you click.</p>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="C:\Users\Hannah Brown\OneDrive - Anderson University\AU_Semester 5\Prod 2\Kairos Process Website\kairos_prison_ministry_international\images\cope_prisonministry.jpg" alt=""/>
					</div>

			<h2>Successful Design</h2>
					<p>The most noticeable and effective elements in these three websites are the strong hierarchy, clear navigation, and use of yellow and gray.</p>
					<ul class="info">
						<li><strong>Crossroads Prison Ministries & Good News Jail & Prison Ministry</strong></li>
						<p>Both websites use a slideshow convention at the top of their homepage to keep the viewer's interest but also give a variety of information in clear sections. The generous negative space and centered text on the Crossroads website gives balance and cohesion. The Good News Jail & Prison website effectively uses infographics to condense information and organize their "Who We Are" section.</p>

							<img src="C:\Users\Hannah Brown\OneDrive - Anderson University\AU_Semester 5\Prod 2\Kairos Process Website\kairos_prison_ministry_international\images\goodnewspage.jpg" alt=""/>
						</div>
						<li><strong>4th Purpose</strong></li>
						<p>This website is perhaps the most modern and easy to navigate out of the three. The hamburger navigational convention is discreetly placed in the top right corner when the page is narrowed, and the menu is frozen to the top of the page as the viewer scrolls. The logo is simple and probes the viewer to find out more about the organization. The home page is clear and also uses infographics and short paragraphs to introduce its mission. 4th Purpose provides helpful and relevant statistics on the amount of individuals incarcerated across the world, and they also have up-to-date information regarding how the organization is continuing to reach out and transform lives in the midst of COVID-19 through a digital series called Visitation 2.0.</p>
